title: Sampling Methods for Counting Temporal Motifs
abstract: "Subgraph isomorphism is a classic and well studied problem in computer science. However, modern graph datasets now contain richer structure, and incorporating temporal information in particular has become a key part of network analysis. In this work we develop fast sampling algorithms for temporal motif counting (subgraph isomorphism where the subgraph must have edges appearing in a specific order). Our results show that we can achieve one to two orders of magnitude speedup over existing algorithms with minimal and controllable loss in accuracy on a number of datasets."
