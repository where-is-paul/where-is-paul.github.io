title: Approximation Algorithms for the Unit Disk Cover Problem in 2D and 3D
abstract: "Given a set P of n points in the plane, we consider the problem of covering P with a minimum number of unit disks. This problem is known to be NP-hard. We present a simple 4-approximation algorithm for this problem which runs in $O(n \\log n)$-time. We also show how to extend this algorithm to other metrics, and to three dimensions."
