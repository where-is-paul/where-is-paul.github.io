title: Approximation Schemes for Covering and Packing in the Streaming Model
abstract: "Within the computational geometry (CG) community, the <b>shifting strategy</b> is a popular algorithmic paradigm for approximation algorithms. In this work we revisit the shifting strategy in the streaming model. Using the streaming-shifting strategy, we give low-memory approximation algorithms for classical CG problems such as unit disc cover. When combined with the shifting coreset technique of Fonseca et al., we are able to approximate streaming variants of geometric dominating set, independent set, etc."
