title: Submodular Optimization in the MapReduce Model
abstract: "Submodular optimization has received significant attention in both practice and theory, as a wide array of problems in machine learning, auction theory, and combinatorial optimization have submodular structure. In practice, these problems often involve large amounts of data, and must
be solved in a distributed way. One popular framework for running such distributed algorithms is MapReduce. In this paper, we present two simple algorithms for cardinality constrained submodular optimization in the MapReduce model: the first is a $(1/2 - o(1))$-approximation in
2 MapReduce rounds, and the second is a $(1 - 1/e - \\epsilon)$-approximation in $\\frac{1+o(1)}{\\epsilon}$ MapReduce rounds."
