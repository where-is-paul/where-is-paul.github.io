title: Characterizing Minimum-Length Coordinated Motions for Two Discs
abstract: "We study the problem of planning coordinated motions
for two disc robots in an otherwise obstacle-free plane.
We give a characterization of collision-avoiding motions
that minimize the total trace length of the disc centres,
for all initial and final configurations of the robots. The
individual traces are composed of at most six (straight
or circular-arc) segments, and their total length can be
expressed as a simple integral with a closed form solution depending only on the initial and final configuration of the robots."
