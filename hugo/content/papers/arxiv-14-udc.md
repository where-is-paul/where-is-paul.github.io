title: A Fast 25/6-approximation for the Minimum Unit Disk Cover Problem
abstract: "My very first paper!

Given a point set in 2D, what is the minimum number of unit radius discs that covers all of the points? This is called the Unit Disk Cover (UDC) problem and has a wide variety of applications in facility location, motion planning, and image processing. Unfortunately, UDC is also NP-Hard.

In this work we present simple and practical $25/6$-approximation algorithms for UDC with runtime $O(n \\log n)$ and space $O(n)$. This algorithm additionally extends to discs in any $\\ell_p$ norm."
