abstract: "A simulator for the pendumlum wave machine (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVkdfJ9PkRQ\">youtube video</a>). This beautiful phenomenon is the result of some pretty interesting physics, all of which is explained <a href=\"http://hippomath.blogspot.com/2011/06/pendulum-waves-mathematical-description.html\">here</a>. I've also made a <a href=\"./webapps/pendulumcalc.html\">calculator</a> to calculate the lengths required for your own pendulum wave machine.

The code was used in the music video for the song <a href=\"https://www.nowness.com/story/crystal-fighters-wave\">Wave</a> by the Crystal Fighters. The video used the calculator and simulator above to set up the machines, as well as some extra calculations that I ran on air resistance of the swingers. The real hard work goes to the guys who built the machine and filmed the video though!
