						<h3>A polynomial lower bound on adaptive complexity of submodular optimization</h3>
						<p> Informally, the adaptive model measures complexity by the longest chain of sequentially dependent calls to f in the algorithm. The focus of the adaptive model is to reward highly parallel algorithms, and penalize algorithms that have high "sequentiality".
						
						Much work has been devoted recently to creating efficient algorithms for submodular optimization (SUBMOD) in the adaptive model. We focus instead on the lower bound, and provide the first lower bound showing that any approximation for monotone SUBMOD takes polynomially many rounds as the approximation factor approaches 1-1/e.

						<h3>Submodular Optimization in the MapReduce model</h3>
						<p> Submodular optimization has received significant attention in both practice and theory, as a wide array of problems in machine learning, auction theory, and combinatorial optimization have submodular structure. In this paper, we present two algorithms for cardinality constrained submodular optimization that greatly simplifies prior works in both analysis and implementation.

						<h3>A Simple Bipartite Graph Projection Model for Clustering in Networks </h3>
						<p> A common operation used in graph processing is that of a "projection". Given a bipartite graph, a projection shrinks the nodes onto one of the two partitions, where two nodes are connected in the projection if they share a common neighbor in the bipartite graph. In this work, we present a simple model for analyzing the projection of bipartite graphs. We derive analytic expressions for common network properties such as sparsity, heavy-tailed degree distributions, and clustering / closure coefficients. We also develop a fast sampling algorithm for our model, which we show is provably optimal for certain input distributions.

						<h3>Retrieving Top Weighted Triangles in Graphs</h3>
						<p> The majority of network datasets consists of unweighted graphs. However, many networks have a natural notion of weight on the edges of the graph. For example, traffic flows in transportation networks or relationship strength in social networks. In this work, we offer efficient algorithms for computing heavy cliques in an arbitrary weighted network. We focus on large-scale networks arising from real-world applications, and show that our method performs orders of magnitudes faster than existing baseline approaches.

						<h3>Sampling Methods for Counting Temporal Motifs</h3>
						<p> Subgraph isomorphism is a classic and well studied problem in computer science. However, modern graph datasets now contain richer structure, and incorporating
temporal information in particular has become a key part of network analysis. In this work we develop fast sampling algorithms for <i>temporal motif counting</i> (subgraph isomorphism where the subgraph must have edges appearing in a specific order). Our results show that we can achieve one to two orders of magnitude speedup over existing algorithms with
minimal and controllable loss in accuracy on a number of datasets.

						<h3>Approximation Schemes for Covering and Packing in the Streaming Model</h3>
						<p> Within the computational geometry (CG) community, the <i>shifting strategy</i> is a popular algorithmic paradigm for approximation algorithms. In this work we revisit the shifting strategy in the streaming model. Using the streaming-shifting strategy, we give low-memory approximation algorithms for classical CG problems such as unit disc cover. When combined with the <i>shifting coreset</i> technique of Fonseca et al., we are able to approximate streaming variants of geometric dominating set, independent set, etc.

						<h3>Characterizing Minimum-length Coordinated Motions for Two Discs</h3>
						<p> We characterize length optimal collision-avoiding motions for a pair of disc robots on an obstacle free plane. The motions are composed of at most six (straight or circular-arc) segments, and their total length can be expressed as a simple integral with a closed form solution depending only on the initial and final positions of the robots.

						<h3>A Fast 25/6-approximation for the Minimum Unit Disk Cover Problem</h3>
						<p>Given a point set P in 2D, what is the minimum number of unit radius discs that covers all of the points? This is called the Unit Disk Cover (UDC) problem and has a wide variety of applications in facility location, motion planning, and image processing. Unfortunately, UDC is also NP-Hard.</p>
                        <p>
                        In this work we present simple and practical 25/6 - approximation algorithms for UDC with runtime O(n log n) and space O(n). This algorithm additionally extends to discs in any Lp norm.

						<h3>Wavelet Turbulence Improved</h3>
						<p>A class project for CS 348C: Physically Based Animation</a>. 
						
						Highly turbulent flows require extremely fine grids to simulate accurately, and is prohibitive for graphics applications. With the Wavelet Turbulence method, procedurally generated turbulence can be added to coarse grid simulations.
						
                        In this project I attempt to refine the ideas of the Wavelet Turbulence to support anisotropic and time-varying noise. See the full paper <a href="files/cs348c-project.pdf">here</a>.</p>

						<h3>CS 368: Algorithmic Techniques for Big Data</h3>
						<p>CS 368 is a grad-level course on algorithms in computing models for large datasets. These models include the streaming and mapreduce models. In this iteration of the course, we designed a new set of programming assignments to accomodate the more "theoretical" assignments that the students usually do. If you like "olympiad-style" programming problems. please do take a look at <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs368/assignments.html">our assignments</a>. Instead of being judged by execution time, your submission succeeds only if you are able to implement it in low enough memory!
                        
                        See <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs368/">here</a> for the course webpage.

						<h3>CS 490: Problem Solving in Computer Science</h3>
						<p>CS 490 is a Student Directed Seminar, and is a 3 credit course organized by senior students at UBC. Students are free to teach whatever they want (subject to a review by the UBC CS department of course), similar to MIT's independent activities period, but with the time commitment of a regular course. CS 490 is typically taught as an Introduction to Programming Contests course by members of the UBC ACM Team. It was lots of fun teaching the course!

						<h3>CS 348C: Computer Graphics: Animation and Simulation</h3>
						<p>While I was struggling to do research in computer graphics, I was fortunate enough to be a teaching assistant for CS 348C. CS 348C is a grad-level course on physically based computer graphics animation. The course required students to produce video results of their work, and every assignment we had a showcase of the best student results. Aside from normal TA duties, I had a lot of fun compositing the submissions into larger music videos (see course webpage!).

						<h3>Science One</h3>
						<p>
                        Science One is an inter-disciplinary course at UBC encompassing all first-year science courses (equivalent of at least six full-credit courses). The students are taught a mega-course encompassing first year Math, Physics, Biology, and Chemistry. Helped design assignments and taught review sessions for the Math portion of the program.

                        See <a href="https://scienceone.ubc.ca/">here</a> for the course webpage.
