      <description>Given at GopherFest 2015. This is an updated version of the talk I gave in NYC Nov 14 at GothamGo.
“We need to think about failure differently. Most people think mistakes are a necessary evil. Mistakes aren&amp;rsquo;t a necessary evil, they aren&amp;rsquo;t evil at all. They are an inevitable consequence of doing something new and as such should be seen as valuable. “ - Ed Catmull

      <description>Not a generic list of programming mistakes, these are the lessons I wish I learned earlier while developing Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past two years developing some of the most popular libraries and applications written in Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a lot of mistakes along the way. Recognizing that &amp;ldquo;The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. -John Powell&amp;rdquo;, I would like to share with you the mistakes that I have made over my journey with Go and when you can avoid them.</description>
